Slight changes of Environmental and Operating Conditions (EOCs) may significantly affect the performance of Structural Health of Monitoring of constructions. 
Present thesis attempts structural health of monitoring in a Vestas V27 wind turbine blade, via a robust non-parametric Stochastic Time Series method under real 
operating and environmental conditions. Random stochastic acceleration measurements are acquired from 12 accelerometers placed in separate positions on the blade 
over a three-month period. The system is studied under a healthy state and three damaged ones, each considering a non-evolving crack of 15, 30 and 45 cm length 
respectively. These damages were artificially induced by creating the smallest one and letting it evolve naturally. Optimal total amount and locations for 
the sensors is investigated via a Coherence Function criterion for the implementation of a non-parametric Multiple Model based method for damage detection. 
Varying EOCs insert a significant level of uncertainty to the data measurements hindering the detection problem. Nevertheless, cracks of 30 and 45 cm length 
are successfully detected with high true positive rates over low false alarms.
